For  practical  reasons,  in  this  paper  we 
selected  a  subset  of  the  PAN  
corpus:  the  first 
simple  string  matching  techniques,  document 
level  processing  is  a  more  realistic  scenario  for 
this  feasibility  study
1,000  suspicious  documents,  along  with  all 
11,147  source  documents.  Since  our  goal  is  to 
investigate  external  plagiarism  of  English  texts, 
all intrinsic and translated plagiarism cases were 
excluded from the dataset. We therefore removed 
186  cases  from  the  subset  of  1,000  suspicious 
documents  and  731  non-English  cases  from  the 

transform  words  into  their  stems  by  removal  of 
derivational  affixes,  for  example:
„computational?, „computing?  and  compute? will 
be returned to the base form comput?. Stemming 
is  used  as  a  common  pre-processing  method  in 
plagiarism  detection  task  and  we  have
